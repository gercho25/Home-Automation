## Introduction

OpenHAB is open-source software which is designed to integrate the many third party pieces of hardware and allow a central place to automate and control them.

OpenHAB will be the center-piece of our architecture and all remote requests will go through it. All other instructions for specific parts will assume that you have followed this set of instructions.

## Pre-requisites

A computer on which to run openhab - it will need to be on 24/7 and be able to run linux. If you don' already own one, we recommend a raspberry pi v2.

If you are using a raspberry pi, you will need to install raspbian - this is the os that these instructions will assume. If you are using a different operating system, you may need to modify some of the commands - although any debian should be very similar.

## Skillsets needed

* basic computer knowledge (the ability to setup a pi, get it booted to an os and connected to the network)
